(I originally planned to keep a weekly journal during GCI, but quickly fell out of habit. This was written back in early November)

I was able to get a much better start to GCI this year. So far, I've completed about 9 tasks. Most have been on the username-availability project. I've quite enjoyed it so far. Trying to get involved and see how I can improve the project more. Was quite surprised at the test suite that username-availability had; it's quite advanced. Hope to learn a few things from it.

So far, managing school with GCI has gone well. I complete my homework after school in a 2 hour sprint. I've recently realized that I can achieve this "sprint" by enforcing strict deadlines on myself; as if the work was due in a matter of hours. This simulates the "panic" and extreme pace of work that happens at school when something is due after lunch, and there are only 15 minutes until lunch ends. Homework should remain low as there are no exams in the foreseeable future. 

Hoping to do more tasks with unit testing, databases, and using aspects of python that I haven't used before (generators and lambdas?).
