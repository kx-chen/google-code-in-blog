Google Code-In 2018 was great in every regard. I found it incredibly rewarding. I learned about many new aspects of python, improved my coding standards, wrote a bunch of tests, and many other things. Throughout 2018, I didn't do as much coding as I would have liked, so doing Google Code-In most certainly made up for it. 

It's so incredibly satisfying to contribute to open source projects and to have other people use your code. I'm hoping to contribute to some projects that I use too, now that I have more experience. I definitely challenged myself throughout these 7 weeks, and now that I look back, I've completed tasks and solved bugs that I didn't even think I was able to solve. 

I'm incredibly grateful to have received assistance from the mentors, who have all worked incredibly hard to make this contest work. A big thanks to all the mentors and students!
