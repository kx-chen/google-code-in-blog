Last year (2017), I was only able to get 5 tasks done, all with the Zulip organization. I had only heard of GCI the day it opened, and was completely unprepared like a fish out of water. 

There were some extremely talented students at Zulip. That, combined with my lack of advanced Git skills, made it extremely hard for me to do more tasks. The ones that I did get through were [a complete mess](https://github.com/zulip/python-zulip-api/pull/224). I did, however, learn A LOT about version control in that one task, which was incredibly helpful, even until today.
