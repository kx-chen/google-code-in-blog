Google Code-In 2018 was my second year participating in Google Code-In. Without a doubt, I had a lot more fun this year. Google Code-In has helped me improve confidence in my coding abilities, meet new people, and work on incredibly exciting open source projects.

This year, I completed [36 tasks](/tasks), contributing to repositories under [coala](https://github.com/coala/).
